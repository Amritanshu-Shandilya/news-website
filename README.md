My Internet Technologies Paper Project I built for my 4th semester


Currently my website looks like this, at the time I submitted my project in College:


<img border=1.5, src = readme_img/Screenshot%20from%202023-04-26%2015-28-47.png> **Homepage**</img>
 Homepage is simple containg the name of the project, some special buttons for functionality (first one shows about us page & second one shows github Repository containing the code), and 2 buttons that open the *News Pane* and *Article Pane* respectively.
 <br>
 <br>

<img border=1.5 src='readme_img/Screenshot%20from%202023-04-26%2015-30-05.png'>**News Pane**</img>
This News Pane is activated when the News button is clicked on the homescreen. This page shows the recent news that are currently hardcoded. But the goal is to automate them using some API in future, so that whenever the user visits the site, he gets latest news.

<img border=1.5 src=readme_img/Screenshot%20from%202023-04-26%2015-31-34.png>**Article Pane**</img>
This Aritcle Pane is activated when the Article button on the homepage is clicked. This page displays the hardcoded embedded links of the website that take the users to the Article pages (on different websites like TheHindu.com). Goal is to later make them display articles preferred by the users. And also enable some filters to allow the reader to select what they want to read.

This page is copied from a website that was made specifically for getting marks in the project. Later this page will become a modal showing the ideology of the project the contributers etc.
